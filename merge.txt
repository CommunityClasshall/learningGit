A bohemian is a person, often an artist or writer, who lives an unconventional, non-conforming life, often in a way that rejects established societal norms. This can include their behavior, appearance, and even their morality. The term "bohemian" also describes a lifestyle and a certain subculture that values artistic freedom and community over material wealth and conformity.
